bimagemgr Release Notes

bimagemgr release 0.3
bacula-gui release 1.38.10

Configuration information has been separated out of bimagemgr.pl into a new 
file config.pm. This file will not be overwritten by the installer when 
upgrading in the future. If you are upgrading from earlier releases you will 
need to transfer your configuration information out of bimagemgr.pl into the 
new config.pm file.

A post install script in the rpm package will add the web server user to the 
group bacula.

Support for SQLite databases has been added.
