2002-04-22 Release 1.18
- Applied Phil's configure.in fix for --prefix, ...
- Fixed bug found by Phil (patch supplied) in updating
  MD5 signatures (revert to 32 bit FileId, move "static"
  variables into JCR) (catreq.c fd-cmds.c).
- Reverted to using INTEGER for FileId in make_sql_tables
  due to a bug in MySQL.
- Change editing code to %d for FileId.
- Remove sqlite in make distclean in cats directory.
- Remove console.conf in console during make distclean
- Remove gnome-console.conf during make distclean
- Remove bacula-dir.conf during make distclean
- Set default level when using Console if none specified.
  Bug reported by Phil.
- A simple . command from Console is ignored.   
- Change program named from filed to bacual-fd in winmain.cpp
- Change default config file for Win32 in winmain.cpp
- Free namebuf on early return from find_one.c. Bug reported by
  Phil.
- Modify testfind.c to dump orphaned buffers.
- Removed terabytes from parse_conf.c because of problems with
  older gcc compilers.
- Turn off gnome options in gnome-console by constructing empty
  argv.

2002-04-18 Release 1.17 Kern Sibbald
- Ensure that platforms Makefiles are called for clean  
  and distclean.
- Hide a lot of Makefile messages with @
- Applied Phil's configure.in patch. Thanks.
- Doc updates, many to clarify points brought up by Phil.
- Applied Phil's make_mysql_tables.in patch. Thanks.
- Made authenticate.c in dird test bnet_send status.
- Make label a bit more friendly with extra info message.
- Add level 200 to debug info in run command.
- Remove old code from findlib/testfind.c so that it compiles.
- Add two minute max wait to cram-md5 authentication. Hopefully,
  this will catch non-responding WinNT daemons.
- Allow time and size modifiers to be upper or lower case.
- Turn off old CYGWIN patch for pthread_cond_timedwait() bug that
  now causes File daemon hangs on WinNT.
- Fix mount messages for restore. Previous updates to save
  broke the restore code.
- By default write fixed block sizes rather than variable block
  sizes.  My Sony DAT simply does not work (reread failures) with
  variable block sizes.
- Data split across tapes was not being correctly restored
  (at least on DAT tapes). 
- Implement MaximumBlockSize and MinumBlockSize statements in
  Storage daemon so user can specify variable block sizes if
  desired.
- Return error if block checksum error on read (previously 
  ignored).
- Fixed some error messages in bls, and in some cases exit(1)
  rather than ABORT. There remain ABORTs to be examined.
- Made a local copy of tcpd.h and corrected the function 
  prototype problem for C++.

2002-04-14 First public release 1.16 Kern Sibbald
 - Many intervening changes/updates.

2001-09-29 Release 1.0 Kern Sibbald
 - Fixes to problems found at John's
   installation.
 - See techlogs/kes25Sep01 for details

2001-09-25 Release 1.0 Kern Sibbald

   He is backing up one Linux machine and
   one Win2000 machine.

2001-mm-dd Many releases
 - Released internally.
  
2000-04-09 Release 0.4 Kern Sibbald
 - Added a lot of Director configuration code. In      
   part (a small part), the Director now uses the
   bacula.conf file to know what to do. There still
   remains a lot to do.
 - The file search code is now integrated into the
   MySQL database routines, and Bacula is now hooked
   into the MySQL database (if so configured). Thus
   all the database records are being created, though
   there still remains some work in getting all the
   details into the records (such as the Storage 
   coordinates).
 - I've defined how Volume pools work (see manual).
 - I've defined error message handling though no code
   is yet written.
 - The following resources and records are implemented
   in the Director configuration file (bacula.conf):
    
   Director
     Name (passed to Storage daemon)
   Client
     Name, Address, Port
     Password (not yet used)
   Storage    
     Name, Address, Port, Password, MediaType
   Job
     Name    
     Type (not yet used)
     Backup (only one permitted) 
       Client, FileSet
     Storage
     Schedule, Messages, Pool (not used)
   FileSet
     Name  
     Include (options ignored)
     Exclude (no options)
   Schedule (not used)
     Name
   Messages (not used)
     Name       
     Debug, syslog, mail, append (not used)
   Catalog
     Name
     Address, Port, Password (not used)
   Pool (not used)
     Name
     PoolType, MediaType (not used)

 - Added Storage configuration routines.
   Director
     Name, password (verified against those sent by Director)
   Storage
     Name, Address, Port (address, port must correspond to Director's values)
     Password, MediaType
   Device
     Name, MediaType (must correspond to those sent by Director)
     Archive Device (defines device name)



2000-03-10 Release 0.3 Kern Sibbald
 - Implemented new base64 encoding for attributes.
   This eliminates some of the error messages in the
   sprintfs on the Solaris due to different stat() sizes.
 - Implemented  the first cut of the file search routines for
   the File daemon.  The exclusion lists work including wild
   cards.   There is a lot of work to be done, but the basic
   structure is now in place (wild cards do not yet work for
   the include).
 - Completed writing the memory pool code.  Now I must
   implement it in the daemons.
 - Modified the bacula start/stop script so that it has a
   better chance of working on SGI and Solaris.
 - The catalog code has not been converted to the new file
   search code.

2000-03-06 Release 0.2 Kern Sibbald
 - Integrated John's fixes.
 - Made Makefiles self configuring when Makefile.in is changed.
 - Added a runit script in the top level that runs bacula
 - Added a "bacula" script in the top level directory that
   starts and stops the File daemon and the Storage daemon.

2000-03-03 Release 0.1 Kern Sibbald
 - Basic Director, File, and Storage daemons.
   Standalone Catalog services using MySQL

2000-01-22 Kern Sibbald
