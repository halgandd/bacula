This is the first release of Bacula, and as such it
is perhaps a bit rough around the edges. As you will
note, I don't follow the standard GNU release numbering
conventions, but rather one that I started in 1970.
My internal releases were 0.nn, the first release to
another user was 1.0, each modified source code release
then gets a new minor release (1.1, ...) as well as
a date. Each major change in the software -- e.g. new
tape format will have the major release number incremented.

Your best bet for getting Bacula up and running
is to read the manual, which can be found in
<bacula-main-directory>/doc/html-manual, or in
<bacula-main-directory>/doc/bacula.pdf.

Barring reading the manual, you might try the
following:

CFLAGS="-g -Wall" \
  ./configure \
    --sbindir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --sysconfdir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-pid-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-subsys-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --enable-gnome \
    --with-mysql=$HOME/mysql \
    --with-working-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin/working \
    --with-dump-email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --with-job-email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --with-smtp-host=YOUR_SMTP_SERVER_ADDRESS \
    --with-baseport=9101


Build Bacula

   make

   There should be no errors.  The most likely source of
   errors will probably come in the src/stored directory
   in time.c or dev.c.  There may also be problems in
   lib/signal.c as I currently pull in all Linux signals,
   some of which may not be available on your system.
