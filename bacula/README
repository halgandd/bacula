As you will note, I don't follow the standard GNU release
numbering conventions, but rather one that I started in
1970.  My internal releases were 0.nn, the first release to
another user was 1.0, each modified source code release then
gets a new minor release (1.1, ...) as well as a date.  Each
major change in the software -- e.g.  new tape format will
normally have the major release number incremented.

Your best bet for getting Bacula up and running is to read
the manual, which can be found in
<bacula-main-directory>/doc/html-manual, or in
<bacula-main-directory>/doc/bacula.pdf.

Barring reading the manual, you might try the
following:

To Configure it:

  ./configure \
    --sbindir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --sysconfdir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-pid-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --with-subsys-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin \
    --enable-gnome \
    --with-mysql=$HOME/mysql \
    --with-working-dir=$HOME/bacula/bin/working \
    --with-dump-email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --with-job-email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --with-smtp-host=YOUR_SMTP_SERVER_ADDRESS


Build Bacula:

   make

   If you are doing a port, there should be no errors.  The most
   likely source of errors will probably come in the src/stored
   directory in time.c or dev.c.  There may also be problems in
   lib/signal.c as I currently pull in all Linux signals, some of
   which may not be available on your system.

To creat the database:

   src/make_bacula_tables

To start it:

   ./startit
   ./console (or ./gnome-console)

To stop it:

  ./stopit

Well, it is all just a bit more complicated than that,
but you should have the idea.
