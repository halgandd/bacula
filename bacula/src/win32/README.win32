This directory <bacula-src>/src/win32 contains the build
environment for building the native Win32 Bacula File daemon,
the native Win32 bconsole program and the wx-console GUI console
program.

The directory structure is:

  bacula/src/win32      Makefiles and scripts
    baculafd            Visual Studio Files
      Release           Release objects, and bacula-fd.exe
       Debug            Debug object, and bacula-fd.exe produced
                           by VC++
    console             Build of console program and bconsole.conf
      Release           Release objects  and bconsole.exe
      Debug             Debug objects 
    wx-console          Buld of wx-console program and wx-console-conf
      Release           Release objects and wx-console.exe
      Debug             Debug objects.

    findlib             Links to core findlib code
    lib                 Links to core lib code

  depkgs-win32
    pthreads            The POSIX pthreads library (third party)
    zlib                The zlib library (third party)
    wx                  The wxWidgets library (third party)

To build it:
- Make sure nmake, and VC++ libraries and includes are setup correctly
  in PATH, INCLUDE, and LIB environment variables.
- cd depkgs-win32
  make
- You may have to build wx with VC++ (as was the case for me).
  In that case, open wx/src/wxWindows.dsp with VC++, select
  static complilation (not the DLL) of "Win32 Release", then
  click build all.
- cd bacula
  ./configure
  cd src/win32
  make

That should be all there is too it. The winbacula-1.xx.y.exe should be
in the current directory.

Here are additional pointers on building wx-console supplied by Nicolas Boichat:


Tools I used (I think the 3 first one are included in VStudio) :
- VC++ toolkit : http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/
- Windows Platform SDK :
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/
   (Core SDK and Internet Development SDK)
- nmake (it got it with .Net Framework SDK)
- lib.exe found in the SDK-base/Bin/win64 directory (works fine
  on a 32 bit Windows).

Instructions if you want to build wx-console :
- wxWidgets 2.4.2 compilation
  + In include/wx/string.h, replace line 195 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)
  + In src/common/string.cpp, replace line 167 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)
  + Follow the instructions in docs/msw/install.txt
     (Visual C++ 6.0 compilation - Using makefiles)

- Add Platform SDK and wxWidgets dirs to VC++ vcvars.bat
  Example :
    Set PATH=F:\MSVC++\bin;F:\MSSDK\bin;%PATH%
    Set
INCLUDE=F:\MSVC++\include;F:\MSSDK\include;F:\wxWindows-2.4.2\include;F:
\wxWindows-2.4.2\lib\msw;%INCLUDE%
    Set LIB=F:\MSVC++\lib;F:\MSSDK\lib;F:\wxWindows-2.4.2\lib;%LIB%
    
- Compile bacula depkg-win32 with Visual Studio or try the
  supplied makefiles as described in the doc.

- Compile wx-console with nmake -f wx-console.mak in
  src/win32/wx-console
