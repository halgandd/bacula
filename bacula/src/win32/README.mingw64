Instructions to build Bacula using the Mingw on Linux
=======================================================

This file documents the tools (scripts) we use for building Bacula for
Microsoft Windows using the cross-compiler tools on a Linux system.  We
use Ubuntu 8.04 so building on that system should definitely work.  But there
shouldn't be any issues on other Linux distributions.

We don't officially support this method, but it is what we use, and it should
build on any Linux machine if you carefully follow the instructions and have
all the prerequisite programs loaded on your machine.

We expect that there may be problems on systems other than Linux where you
are pretty much on your own.  However, we will try to provide responses to
your questions on the bacula-devel list, but we can't guarantee anything.

Directory Structure
=====================
The new directory structure is:

  bacula-top                 Top level directory -- any name
    bacula                   Top level Bacula source directory -- any name
      src
        win32                Main directory where Windows version is built.

      mingw-w64/bin/               / 



One-time Setup
==============

If you're reading this file you've probably already enlisted in the SVN tree or
extracted the contents of the source tar.  If not you need to do that first.

You also need to download one of the doc tar balls and extract to your
top level Bacula directory. 

The extracted doc directory name will be bacula-docs-version where version
is the version number.  The directory must be renamed to docs (ie remove
the leading bacula- and the -version portion of the name).

Note, a number of packages must be installed to build the cross-tools
and the depkgs files.  Most are rather standard such as gcc, g++,
make, ...  However a few that you may not have are:

  texinfo
  flex
  bison
  patch (Debian)
  m4
  postgresql (at least client)
  mysql (at least client)
  SQLite3 (from depkgs or as package)
  readline (readlineN-dev on Debian)
  ...

NB: On Debian, I had to remove /usr/bin/lorder for
postresql to build correctly.

Build the 32 bit cross-tools and mingw32:

Once the source is on your system, change to the win32 directory
        cd .../bacula/src/win32

Download and build the cross compiler tools
        ./build-win32-cross-tools

Download and build the 3rd party dependencies
        ./build-depkgs-mingw32

Note, that during the build process you will see a moderate amount of
output. If something fails, it is probably because you don't have one
of the build dependencies (hopefully all mentioned above) loaded on your  
system. To find out what is going wrong, do the following:

  cd .../depkgs-mingw32/src/<package-name>
   
where <package-name> is where the package is unpacked and built. Normally
it is relatively obvious when looking at the src directory.             

In that directory, you should find a make.log, which has the full details
of the compiles, links, and installs done for that package.

Build the 64 bit cross-tools and mingw64:
When building the mingw64 environment and all dependencies
(cross-tools, and depkgs-mingw64) should be compiled by hand with
host=x86_64-pc-linux and target=x86_64-pc-mingw32.  

For that, use this configure line :
./configure --host=x86_64-pc-linux --target=x86_64-pc-mingw32 --prefix=$ROOT/cross-tools
or
./configure --host=x86_64-pc-linux --target=x86_64-pc-mingw32 --prefix=$ROOT/depkgs-mingw64

(It can work with other setup). We are using binutils-2.19, gcc-4.3.2,
gmp-4.2.4, mpfr-2.3.2. The mingw64 project delivers binaries that should do the
work.

Internal scripts and patches are using mingw32-xxx binaries, so you need to
make links in the gcc bin ($ROOT/cross-tools/mingw-w64/bin) directory.

---8<------8<-------8<--------

for i in x86_64-pc-mingw32-*
do
    ln -s $i ${i##x86_64-pc-}
done

---8<------8<-------8<--------

They provide also a pthread lib but we aren't sure that they will work, you
can compile it yourself using the pthreads-snap-2004-06-22.tar.gz (same as
mingw32) + pthread-win64.patch.

The openssl lib version is openssl-0.9.8j.tar.gz + openssl-win64.patch

See External-mingw-w64 for download location (available on www.bacula.org).

You need the header files from the Microsoft VSS SDK.  Unfortunately the SDK
can only be downloaded and installed on a Windows system.  We do not have
the right to distribute it, so you must download it yourself.
You can find it on Microsoft's web-site at:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0b4f56e4-0ccc-4626-826a-ed2c4c95c871&DisplayLang=en

If that link doesn't work then go to http://www.microsoft.com and search for

        "download volume shadow copy service sdk"

we are currently using version 7.2 released 8/3/2005.

Normally the files will be installed in:

        c:\Program Files\Microsoft\VSSSDK72

You only need to copy everything under the c:\Program Files\Microsoft\VSSSDK72\inc
directory into .../depkgs-mingw32/vss/inc. and .../depkgs-mingw-w64/vss/inc 
In doing so, please ensure that
the case in maintained on the directory and filenames -- some contain uppercase 
characters !!!

The above only needs to be done once unless we change the cross-tools
or the dependencies versions.  In general, you can run the script multiple
times with no problem.  For it to work, you must have at a minimum the
following:

        gcc
        g++
        wget
        texinfo
        bison
        flex
        python
        unzip
        tar

and possibly other packages.


Building
========

Finally, to build the Microsoft Windows version of Bacula, do the following:

   cd .../bacula/src/win32
   make clean
   ./makeall

or
  cd .../bacula/src/win32
  make clean
  make
  make WIN64=yes

This builds both the 32 bit version and the 64 bit version.
The binaries are in the release32 and release64 directories.



Updating the 3rd party package patches
======================================

If one of the patches changes in .../bacula/src/win32/patches, you will
need to update the corresponding dependency.

Adding a new global function or global data
===========================================

bacula.dll
----------

The code from the following directories is built into bacula.dll:

   .../bacula/src/lib
   .../bacula/src/libfind
   .../bacula/src/win32/compat

A new function or data variable which must be accessed from outside
of bacula.dll requires special treatment.  It must be specifically
exported.

New data variables are exported by adding the macro DLL_IMP_EXP to
the variable declaration in the header file.  All exported variables
must be declared in a header file and MUST NOT be declared in a
source file referencing the variable. Example, src/lib/runscript.h:

extern DLL_IMP_EXP bool (*console_command)(JCR *jcr, const char *cmd);

or src/jcr.h

extern int DLL_IMP_EXP num_jobs_run;
extern DLL_IMP_EXP dlist * last_jobs;
...


Exporting functions is now more or less automated.  If you find that
a function name has been added, changed, or an argument modified,    
simply do the following:

   cd .../bacula/src/win32/lib
   make                  (to build the .o files, note the link will fail)
   ./make_def >bacula64.def   or >bacula64.def

This should rebuild the bacula.def file, but it uses relative paths
and assumes you have the directory structure noted above. If you 
are using something different, you can set the NM variable at the
top of the make_def file to use an absolute path to the correct
directory.

===== manual changing of bacula32.def or bacula64.def no longer necessary =====
If you want to do it manually, please see below:
Exporting a function requires a bit more work.  You must determine the
C++ mangled name of the new function.

   strings .../bacula/src/win32/lib/<file>.o | grep <symbol>

Note, strings often will not show the desired symbol. In that case,
use:
   
   nm .../bacula/src/win32/lib/<file>.o

Replace <file> with the base part of the name of the source code file
which contains the new function.  Replace <symbol> with the name of
the new function.  Remove the leading underscore and place the result
in the file

   .../bacula/src/win32/lib/bacula64.def
=== end manual changing of bacula64.def ==========

If you add a new file, you will need to specify its name in

   .../bacula/src/win32/lib/Makefile
and
   .../bacula/src/win32/libbac/Makefile


Running gdb on the Win32 files
==================================================
You can use the mingw64 gdb to debug Bacula on Win64 by downloading
it from Source Forge:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=202880&package_id=311650


Download one of their .exe versions, which is an installer that you
can run on Win32 to install gdb.  This gdb is built with mingw64 so will
run independently of any cygwin installation.  Note, not all the releases
come with an installer. I had to go back 3 or 4 versions to find it.  Otherwise
you can download the source and build it.  Thanks to Eric Bollengier for
this tip.


Structure of the MinGW64/32 build environment
==========================================

The basic strategy is each Makefile in the various subdirectories includes
Makefile.inc, defines variables and rules specific to what is being built,
then includes Makefile.rules which defines all the rules.

Makefile.inc defines the locations of all the dependencies and the compiler
and linker flags.  It is automatically created from Makefile.inc.in.  Any
changes must be made to Makefile.inc.in not Makefile.inc or they will be
overwritten the next time Makefile.inc.in is updated.

Makefile.rules defines a bunch of macros to simplify building.  It also
includes all the basic rules for building objects, GUI and console
executables, etc.

Makefile.template is a template for creating new Makefiles, if you are
creating a new directory, copy Makefile.template to Makefile in that
directory and edit to suit.
