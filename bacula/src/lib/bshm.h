 * Bacula Shared Memory structure

 *
 *     NB: these items are deprecated.  Shared memory was
 *         used in a first version of the Storage daemon
 *         when it forked. Since then it has been converted
 *         to use threads.  However, there are still some
 *         vestiges of the shared memory code that remain and
 *         can be removed.
