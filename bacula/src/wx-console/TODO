BUGS
----

Reported by Thorsten (May 15 2005 4:23 PM):
During my work (I used vs.net 2003) I noticed a few smaller glitches, but don't know if the problems lie within wx-console or the wxWindows library:
- start wx-console -> enter quit -> memory leaks
- start wx-xonsole in debug mode -> drawing error (empty console screen), one click to a scrollbar -> text is back (fixed, t.engel)
- after "quit" of console -> director claims unexpected communication interruption


Old TODO list
-------------

general : Show nice messages boxes when errors occurs.
   
wxbRestorePanel : list jobs and list jobid=# will probably crash if there
   is nothing to show (db error or empty table)
   
GTK2 : The console control is not scrolled correctly (wxGTK bug)

Win32 : Crash when quitting while trying to connect

Mac OS X : "You must first get a unique identifier for your application, 
  a so called creator, a four letter constant. All you need to know about
  this step is at http://developer.apple.com/dev/cftype/" (wxWiki)
  To be modified in Makefile.in wx-console target
  
Mac OS X : Ask kern for the status of this distribution (who is
  the package releaser ?)

wxbRestorePanel : Add images in add/remove/refresh buttons

wxbRestorePanel : disable controls when working or (better) queue events
  (see commented out code in wxbrestorepanel (marked with EVTQUEUE))

wxbMainFrame : When exiting using menu, a messagebox is shown to ask the
  user if he want to quit because the connection is lost. (doesn't
  happen on Linux)

wxbUtils : add clients, jobs, filesets, pools... list, merge patch file (wxbnewutils.patch)

general : do not show some commands results (for example .help)

general : add a tab containing messages

wxbConfigFileEditor : create a more precise editor, with something like
   a tree structure

wxbRestorePanel : When cancelling, check for commands results

wxbRestorePanel : Add a way to cancel restore when building tree
   (needs director modifications)

wxbMainFrame : set focus to type control when clicking on console

wxbConfigPanel : Create a dialog for selecting dates and paths.

wxbMainFrame : use more often status text
   
wxbRestorePanel : Use ".default job=RestoreFiles" to get defaults parameters
	when changing a restore parameter fails.

wxbDataParser : Add a boolean in the constructor to avoid storing data which 
    will not be used.

wxbRestorePanel : Check if commands ran successfully (cd, mark, mods...).

GTK : Improve look

wxblistctrl/wxbtreectrl : Find why events are not forwarded correctly 
  to parent' parent, and correct bad actual implementation.
   (remove handler parameter in wxTreeCtrl/wxListCtrl constructor)

Win32 : find out why I had to modify string.cpp and string.h
  + In include/wx/string.h, replace line 195 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)
  + In src/common/string.cpp, replace line 167 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)

mingw : correct findlib stat blocks and block size
        (Note : nothing to do with wx-console)

wxbRestorePanel : The + only appears when one selects a directory, 
   to indicate it has subdirectories

wxbRestorePanel : Add a timeout when waiting for commands results

bacula-dir : correct director to handle correctly + marked status
   (In fact there is a bug in the director : If you mark a directory
   (not a file), and then unmark it, its parents keep the "+" status.)

general : make a good documentation with snapshots
