FEATURES
--------

GTK : Fix 100% CPU usage when waiting for results

wxbMainFrame : Add some text in front of the command window such as 
   "Command: " so that the user knows he can type into the 
   command line
   
wxbRestorePanel : Reconsider start button's labels.

wxbRestorePanel : Implement cancel button when first configuring

wxbRestorePanel : Change defaults values when Job Name changes (first configure)

wxbRestorePanel : Add titles to configuration panel

general : Show nice messages when errors occurs.

wxbMainFrame : set focus to type control when clicking on console

wxbRestorePanel : Add a Cancel Restore button
   (may need to implement BNET_BREAK to break current command)

general : Allow the user to quit however the state is (kill thread if necessary)

VC++ : crashing when there's no configuration file, when server is unreachable,
       when connection has been interrupted and wants to quit (on every error ?)

[postponed to July:]

global : create a general class which keeps clients, filesets, pools... list.

wxbMainFrame : use more often status text

wxbRestorePanel : Ask Kern for a dot command which gives restore
  dates for a client (with an interval, last 20 for example, or last
  40 excluding last 20).

wxbRestorePanel : Add buttons to mark/unmark directories/files.

wxbRestorePanel : Add a button to force to refresh the whole tree

wxbRestorePanel : Put titles above the Client drop down 
     box and the Backup date drop down box. It isn't immediately 
     obvious that the dates correspond to the backup dates.

wxbRestorePanel : There needs to be some way of marking/unmarking a range of 
     files selected with shift-click or multiple files selected 
     with ctl-click. The GTX console uses a button to mark/unmark 
     the selected entries.
     
wxbRestorePanel : Is there any way to add a width adjustment handle between 
     the tree view window and the file view window so that the 
     width of the tree view can be changed?

general : Implement reconnecting

wxbRestorePanel : Use ".default job=RestoreFiles" to get defaults parameters
	when changing a restore parameter fails.

console_thread : Allow the user to choose his config file.

console_thread : Allow the user to choose his director when there's multiple
    directors.

wxbDataParser : Add a boolean in the constructor to avoid storing data is 
    will not be used.

wxbTableParser : Replace wxHashMap by wxArray

wxbRestorePanel : Check if commands ran successfully (cd, mark, mods...).

GTK : Improve look

wxblistctrl/wxbtreectrl : Find why events are not forwarded correctly 
  to parent' parent, and correct bad actual implementation.
   (remove wxbTreeListPanel)

general : find out why I had to modify string.cpp and string.h
  + In include/wx/string.h, replace line 195 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)
  + In src/common/string.cpp, replace line 167 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)

mingw : correct findlib stat blocks and block size
        (Note : nothing to do with wx-console)

wxbRestorePanel : Check more carefully which job we just have run
   (needs director modification).

wxbRestorePanel : The + only appears when one selects a directory, 
   to indicate it has subdirectories

wxbRestorePanel : Add a timeout when waiting for commands results

bacula-dir : correct director to handle correctly + marked status
   (In fact there is a bug in the director : If you mark a directory
   (not a file), and then unmark it, its parents keep the "+" status.)

general : make a good documentation with snapshots

BUGS
----

wxRestorePanel : When you double-click an a folder in the list, 
      the list is then refreshed two times (instead of one) 
      in the new directory
