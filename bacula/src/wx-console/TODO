general : Show nice messages boxes when errors occurs.

Win32 : Crash when quitting while trying to connect

Mac OS X : "You must first get a unique identifier for your application, 
  a so called creator, a four letter constant. All you need to know about
  this step is at http://developer.apple.com/dev/cftype/" (wxWiki)
  To modify in Makefile.in wx-console target
  
Mac OS X : Ask kern for the status of this distribution (who is
  the package releaser ?)

wxbRestorePanel : Implement refresh buttons

wxbRestorePanel : Add images in add/remove/refresh buttons

general : replace delete by delete [] when needed

wxbRestorePanel : disable controls when working

[postponed to July:]

wxbConfigFileEditor : create a more precise editor, with something like
   a tree structure

wxbRestorePanel : When cancelling, check for commands results

wxbRestorePanel : Add a way to cancel restore when building tree
   (needs director modifications)

wxbMainFrame : set focus to type control when clicking on console

global : create a general class which keeps clients, jobs, 
	filesets, pools... list, and with functions like WaitForEnd.

wxbConfigPanel : Create a dialog for selecting dates and paths.

wxbMainFrame : use more often status text

wxbRestorePanel : Ask Kern for a dot command which gives restore
  dates for a client (with an interval, last 20 for example, or last
  40 excluding last 20).
    
wxbRestorePanel : Use ".default job=RestoreFiles" to get defaults parameters
	when changing a restore parameter fails.

wxbDataParser : Add a boolean in the constructor to avoid storing data which 
    will not be used.

wxbRestorePanel : Check if commands ran successfully (cd, mark, mods...).

GTK : Improve look

wxblistctrl/wxbtreectrl : Find why events are not forwarded correctly 
  to parent' parent, and correct bad actual implementation.
   (remove handler parameter in wxTreeCtrl/wxListCtrl constructor)

general : find out why I had to modify string.cpp and string.h
  + In include/wx/string.h, replace line 195 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)
  + In src/common/string.cpp, replace line 167 by
      #if defined(__VISUALC__) // && defined(_MT) && !defined(_DLL)

mingw : correct findlib stat blocks and block size
        (Note : nothing to do with wx-console)

wxbRestorePanel : The + only appears when one selects a directory, 
   to indicate it has subdirectories

wxbRestorePanel : Add a timeout when waiting for commands results

wxbRestorePanel : Be sure of which job we just have run (not suppositions
   as I'm doing now) : needs director modification.

bacula-dir : Progress status when building tree.

bacula-dir : correct director to handle correctly + marked status
   (In fact there is a bug in the director : If you mark a directory
   (not a file), and then unmark it, its parents keep the "+" status.)

general : make a good documentation with snapshots
