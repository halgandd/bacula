          Release Notes for Bacula 1.29

  Bacula code: Total files = 228 Total lines = 62,662 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- This release is primarily a bug fix release. I spent a great
  deal of time searching for any possible buffer overflow, stress
  testing the memory allocator, and eliminating places where bad
  input or strange characters could cause a crash.  
- All known 1.28 bugs have been fixed.
- Allow dynamic input of files into Include statements via a
  program or reading a file. E.g.
     Include = {
        "|program input"
        "<file_input"
- Allow backup of raw partitions.
- Allow input of data for backup via a fifo -- good for doing a
  "hot" backup of a database.
- Fixed a major bug that caused Bacula to crash if there were error
  messages in the catalog interface code and you started two jobs
  at the same time.
- Fixed a buffer overrun bug found by James MacLean in filename quoting
  if you had very long filenames with many single quotes in it.
- Fixed a number of "recursive" calls to the print routines that would
  eventually cause a crash -- pointed out by James MacLean.


Other Changes this Release:
- Bigendian is detected in configure making porting easier.
- Added beginning of Gentoo platform files
- Improved mtx-changer for handling subtle differences between differen
  versions of mtx. Also beginning of handling Bar Code reading.
- Quite a number of updates to the manual, with more examples ... 
- Documented tape drive modes expected by Bacula.
- Enhanced the dbcheck program with a few more options and better
  user control as well as better display.
- Fixed a bug in VolumeUseDuration reported by George Motter.
- Implemented thread timer routines, currently used to time out FIFO's,
  but ultimately will monitor connections.
- Improved error reporting. Initial errors no longer changed by later errors.
  Both FD and SD exit status reported in Backup output report.
- Cancel now work within the File daemon (previously it always traversed all
  files).
- New Volume Files option for "update" that allows correcting incorrect volume       
  file count entries in catalog due to a program crash.
- Removed virtually all sm_check()s -- should run a bit faster.


Items to note:
- Version 1.28 File daemons can be used with version 1.29, but it
  is preferable to upgrade.
