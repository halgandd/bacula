          Release Notes for Bacula 1.27

  Bacula code: Total files = 222 Total lines = 60,486 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- Implemented support for Sparse files.
- Implemented support for all Win32 attributes.
- New Volume format. Will permit faster restores,
  and correct restores of Volumes written with multiple
  simultaneous jobs.
- Important change to communications protocol. Eliminated
  deprecated 0 signal. 
- Implemented VolumeUseDuration (duration Volume can be written)
- Implemented MaximumVolumeJobs (max jobs written to volume) see
  the Pool documentation for the Director for more details.
- Rework of the Web site.
- New format for the User's Guide (manual).
- New bcopy tool (works but not totally complete).
- All bxxx tool programs MUST read a Storage daemon configuration file.
- Mount Anonymous Volumes is now dropped from the Storage
  daemon configuration files.
- Accept Any Volume is by default "Yes" and permits Bacula
  to accept any appendable volume from the pool. Previously,
  it would accept ONLY the next appendable volume. To get
  the old behavior add "Accept Any Volume = No" to the
  Storage resources of your Director's configuration file.
- New database format. You must either re-initialize your database or
  use <bacula-src>/src/cats/alter_mysql_tables (or alter_sqlite_tables)
  to upgrade an existing database.

Minor Changes this Release:
- A number of small bug fixes.
- Improve handling of the "Where" prefix on Win32 by first
  stripping any previous drive. This allows restoration to
  any drive.
- Modified Director-FD logon sequence to pass the OS id strings
  to the director.
- Fixed mount loop when the autochanger slot is incorrect in 
  the catalog.
- Updated the bacula start/stop script to work on more systems.
- Fixed many places prone to buffer overflows.
- Scripts are now found in <bacula-src>/scripts
- A mtx-changer script was contributed for the Sony
  TLS-11000 autochanger.  It is in <bacula-src>/examples

Items to note:
- You must re-initialize or alter your databases.
- The inter-daemon protocol has changed so you must
  upgrade all your daemons (and all Clients).

- First make a backup.
- Configure and build Bacula

- For MySQL
   cd <bacula-src>/src/cats
   ./alter_mysql_tables

- For SQLite
