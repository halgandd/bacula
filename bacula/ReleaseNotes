          Release Notes for Bacula 1.27

  Bacula code: Total files = 218 Total lines = 59,267 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- Implemented support for Sparse files.
- Implemented support for all Win32 attributes.
- New Volume format. Will permit faster restores,
  and correct restores of Volumes written with multiple
  simultaneous jobs.

Minor Changes this Release:
- Mount Anonymous Volumes is now dropped from the Storage
  daemon configuration files.
- Accept Any Volume is by default "Yes" and permits Bacula
  to accept any appendable volume from the pool. Previously,
  it would accept ONLY the next appendable volume. To get
  the old behavior add "Accept Any Volume = No" to the
  Storage resources of your Director's configuration file.
- Improve handling of the "Where" prefix on Win32 by first
  stripping any previous drive. This allows restoration to
  any drive.

Items to note:
- The Dir-SD protocol has changed since 1.26, so you must
  update the Director and Storage daemons.
