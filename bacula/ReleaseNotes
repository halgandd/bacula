          Release Notes for Bacula 1.30-22Apr03 BETA

  Bacula code: Total files = 235 Total lines = 67,254 (*.h *.c *.in)

Major Changes this Release:
- The Windows Client now uses Cygwin 1.3.20 and should be much 
  more reliable.                    
- Implemented save/restore of chflags for FreeBSD systems.
- Support for FreeBSD tape drives.
- Support for SHA1 signatures in addition to MD5 (more secure).
- The btape "test" command is much more comprehensive and automatically
  tries different options.
- Implemented support for barcodes ("label barcodes", "update slots").
- Make Incremental and Differential saves backup all files changed as
  well as all files moved into save path (added st_ctime to check).
- Preliminary support for cleaning tapes in autochangers.
- Restores directory permissions and times correctly.
- Relabel Purged tapes with the relabel command.
- Support for Win95 systems (I hope).

  is error terminated.
