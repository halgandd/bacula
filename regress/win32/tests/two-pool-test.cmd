REM This is Arno's test.  It uses two pools, two tapes, and
REM  an autochanger. Note, the Director has three Pools in its 
REM  conf:  Default, Full, and Inc.  Default is used in the
REM  NightlySave job by default.  What is backed up is what
REM  is in ${cwd}/tmp/file-list, which is by default the Bacula
REM  source code (i.e. the build directory).

REM  Note, we use the virtual disk autochanger.
